<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Number</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>Select the appropriate asset type for the new asset.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>Upon selecting an asset type, relevant fields for the asset will be displayed. For example, an asset of type "Food" may require four specific fields to be completed.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Panthora's flexibility allows it to function as a food tracker, assisting in inventory management. Utilizing tags can enhance organization, such as indicating the location of items like eggs.
