# Rate Limit

Tory will enforce rate-limits for API requests done by the user.

This is mainly used to secure the Password Authentication method. See [Configuration](./configuration.md) to disable.

> [!WARNING]  
> Disabling rate limiting on public instances, especially when using Password Authentication is highly discouraged!
