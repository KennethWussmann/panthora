# Rate Limit

Panthora will enforce rate-limits for API requests done by the user.

This is mainly used to secure the Password Authentication method. See [Configuration](./configuration) to disable.

<Callout type="warning">
  Disabling rate limiting on public instances, especially when using Password
  Authentication is highly discouraged!
</Callout>
