Panthora is a web-based application that allows you to create and manage your own personal inventory. It is designed to be simple and easy to use, while still providing powerful features to help you organize and manage your assets.

## Demo Instance

You can try out Panthora by visiting our demo instance at [https://demo.panthora.app](https://demo.panthora.app). The demo instance resets every 24 hours, and allows you to explore the software and see how it works.

## Getting Started

<Steps>
### Deploy Your Instance

Check the [Docker deployment guide](./hosting/deploy-with-docker) to get started with Panthora.

### Create your Asset Types

Asset Types are the categories of assets you want to manage. For example, you might have asset types for books, electronics, or tools. They give your assets structure and help you organize and manage them.

See the [Asset Types guide](./usage/asset-types) to learn how to create your own asset types.

### Create your Assets

It's time to start adding your assets. You can add as many assets as you want, and you can customize them to fit your needs.

See the [Assets guide](./usage/assets) to learn how to create your own assets.

### Learn More

Panthora can do a lot more than just manage your assets.

## ðŸ¤– Ask the AI

You can find the Panthora AI here: [Panthora AI](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-3bQ9bDq9a-panthora)

It is trained with this documentation and can help you to find the right information. Ask it anything about Panthora and it will try to help you.

It can also generate templates for you, if you are confused with asset types and assets, and just want to get started quickly. Ask it to generate a template for you, and tell it what exactly you want to manage with Panthora. The generated JSON can then be imported into Panthora: [Importing Data](./templates/using-templates#importing-template)
