# Templates

Templates are specialized JSON formats that define the structure of asset types and tags. These templates enable the sharing of Panthora use-case structures in a standardized manner, facilitating collaboration and reuse.

## Examples

1. [Home Library](./example-home-library) - Managing a Home Library with Panthora

## Writing a Template

Templates are crafted in JSON format. To begin, create a new JSON file, with the following structure:

```json filename="book-library.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://panthora.app/import-0.2.0.schema.json",
  "name": "Book Library",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "A concise description of the template's purpose.",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "tags": [],
  "assetTypes": []
}
```

Utilizing an editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) enhances the experience by offering code completion guided by the `$schema`, aiding in the accurate development of the template.

To populate the template, add tags and asset types as needed. Refer to the [example templates for inspiration](#examples) and guidance on potential configurations.

## Leveraging AI for Panthora Structure Generation

For those seeking a more streamlined approach, the AI-powered generator simplifies the template creation process. By providing a brief description of the intended Panthora use-case, the AI generates a bespoke template that can be directly imported into Panthora, eliminating the need for manual JSON composition.
