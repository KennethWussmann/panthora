Discover more in the [Usage Guide](https://docs.panthora.app/usage/getting-started).

### Assets

Define "assets" as items you wish to track, whether they're groceries, books, or collectibles. Panthora enables you to monitor any number of assets, ensuring you always stay organized.

Dive deeper: [Understanding Assets](https://docs.panthora.app/usage/assets)

### Asset Types

Asset Types introduce structure to your inventory. Customize the details you track for each item category, like author, genre, and page count for books, to make your inventory system truly yours.

Learn more: [Setting Up Asset Types](https://docs.panthora.app/usage/asset-types)

### Tags

Organize your assets with tags for effortless filtering. Whether marking books as `unread` or categorizing pantry items, tags simplify finding exactly what you need, when you need it.

### Teams

With Teams, you can group assets, asset types, and tags, creating distinct inventories for different purposes or groups. Share your collections with others by inviting them to your team, from family members sharing pantry items to colleagues collaborating on business inventories.
